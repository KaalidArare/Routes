# Function 
The app works as an application to apply for a tournament. The home page 
contains the fields, and navigation menus leading to two more pages. When the user submits
the application, they'll see a confirmation page containing the information they just entered.
They can also view all the other submissions with the help of the mysql database. The confirmation 
page is just there to confirm the application being done but the submissions page displays all the applications on a table.

# Limitations 

Some limitations with my page is not being able display the most recent entries on the table at the top even though I tried using 
timestamp DESC. The app wipes out the previous entry when you "go back" from another page requiring you to enter 
the information again. I could have done better job with the buttons and styling more to make it more appealing.
